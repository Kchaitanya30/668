```         
my_variable <- 10 > 
#Why does this code not work? ____ 
> my_variable <- 10 > my_varıable Error: object 'my_varıable' not found 
> # As this code doesn't work because there is a mistake in the object name, I have created a object with my_variable name but I have not createda variable with my_varıable. Slight mistake in the name will show an error. 
> my_variable [1] 10
